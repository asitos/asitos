## hey, i'm ashutosh

i'm a curious learner who loves building things from scratch.  
currently learning full-stack web development through [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), and having a lot of fun along the way.  

i’m really into problem-solving, front-end design, and clean code — slowly figuring things out, one line at a time.

## what i'm up to right now

- diving deep into javascript and dom manipulation  
- solving dsa problems daily (almost always... 😅)  
- building small browser-based projects for fun  
- working through my btech in computer science  
- exploring linux, open source and development workflows
